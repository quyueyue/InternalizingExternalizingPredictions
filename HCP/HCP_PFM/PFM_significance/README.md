# PFM significance mask for HCP analyses

This folder contains code used to generate predictive feature weight significance mask for both single- and multi-kernel models from PFM permutation results stored in `$IntExt_Dir/HCP/HCP_perm_output/PFM/`.

Suppose that the output directory for the predictive feature weight significance mask is the same as PFM permutation results,

Run `sbatch compute_PFM_significance_KRR.sh`
