# PFM significance mask for HBN analyses

This folder contains code used to generate predictive feature weight significance mask from PFM permutation results stored in `$IntExt_DIR/HBN/HBN_perm_output/PFM/`.

Suppose that the output directory for the predictive feature weight significance mask is the same as PFM permutation results,

## Implementation

Run `sbatch compute_PFM_significance_HBN.sh`
