# Distinct brain network features predict internalizing and externalizing traits in children, adolescents and adults

# BACKGROUND
We used resting-state functional connectivity to predict a range of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Human Connectome Project (HCP) datasets. Across all three samples, behaviors within internalizing and externalizing categories exhibited more similar predictive feature weights than behaviors between categories. These data suggest shared and unique brain network features account for individual variation within broad internalizing and externalizing categories across developmental stages.

# USAGE
## Setup
1. Make sure you have installed: Matlab 2018b
2. Follow the instructions carefully to set up the CBIG environment in your local environment. The instructions are available at: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/blob/master/setup/README.md. Instead of using CBIG/setup/CBIG_sample_config.sh, you need to use InternalizingExternalizingPredictions/setup/CBIG_TRBPC_tested_config_adapted.sh.
