# PFM significance mask for ABCD analyses

This folder contains code used to generate predictive feature weight significance mask from PFM permutation results stored in `$IntExt_Dir/ABCD/ABCD_perm_output/PFM/`

Suppose that the output directory for the predictive feature weight significance mask is the same as PFM permutation results,


## Implementation
Run `sbatch compute_PFM_significance_KRR.sh`
